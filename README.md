# Comparing predictive models, for their performance, cost and participant time needed

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this project is to assess and compare the performance of different predictive model in term of discriminative power, calibration, cost and participant time thanks to the dataset generated by the [Trialnet network](https://www.trialnet.org/researchers).


The project is split in three parts; **analysis**, **article** and **model parameters**.



## Model fitting and model assement

The main script to generate all the model and assess their performances can be found in `main_load.R`


## Article preparation

The main file to generate the figures are in the directory `R/article` and in `article/tables_quarto`

## Predictive model objects

the Predictive model R objects can be found in the `pareto_front_models folder`. The model coefficient are in the file `model_coefficients.xlsx`.
