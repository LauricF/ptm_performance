The goal of T1Dprediction_trialnet project is to assess and compare the performance of different predictive model in term of discriminative power, calibration, cost and participant time thanks to the dataset generated by the [Trialnet network](https://www.trialnet.org/researchers).


The project is split in two parts; analysis and article preparation.



## model fitting and model assement

The main script to generate all the model and assess their performances can be found in main_load.R


## article preparation

The main file to generate the figures are in the directory R/article and in article/tables_quarto

## predictive model objects

the Predictive model objects can be found in the pareto_front_models folders.
